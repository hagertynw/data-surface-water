Used first tab: "WRUDS 2015-06-15". File too large to import into Stata, so first saved each tab as a separate worksheet.

This spreadsheet is explained in Exhibit WR-11, Testimony of Jeffrey Yeazell, downloaded from:

"The Information Order was sent to 1,061 Statement holders representing the top 90% of reported Riparian and Pre-1914 demand in the Delta, and the top 90% of reported Riparian and Pre-1914 demand in the Sacramento and San Joaquin watersheds. The order required, among other items, that those diverters report their actual diversions for 2014 and forecasted diversions for 2015."
