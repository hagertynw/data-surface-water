INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES' 
DETAILED ANALYSIS UNIT DIGITAL MAP (DWRDAUV20)
December 17, 2003


The Department of Water Resources (DWR) uses Detailed Analysis Units (DAU) as 
the base geographic unit for most statewide planning purposes.  There are 278 
DAU's that cover all of mainland California.  The DAU's are nested inside 46 
Planning Subareas (PSA), which in turn are nested inside of 10 Hydrologic 
Regions (HR). 

Development of the DAU GIS data:

1.  DWR used, as a starting point, the vector data from Calwater 2.0.  This 
vector data was provided to all four DWR District Offices.  Each District 
Office made the decisions as to which vector lines were to be used from the 
Calwater 2.0 data.  

2.  The District Offices then digitized, from previously drawn DAU boundaries 
drawn on USGS 1:24,000 maps, those DAU lines which were not taken from the 
Calwater 2.0 data.  

3.  All four Districts' digital data was then brought together at Headquarters 
into one file, and run through quality control procedures to clean up the 
linework, and attribute each DAU appropriately, creating a draft digital map.  

4.  The draft DAU digital map was reviewed by Headquarters and the four 
District Offices, and all discovered errors were corrected.  

5.  Two products were finalized:

  a.  An AUTOCAD DWG file, DWRDAUV10.DWG (version 1.0), which contains the 
  linework and limited attributes (just the DAU code).  
  b.  A Shape file(s), DWRDAUV10.SHP, .SHX, .DBF (version 1.0), which 
  contains the polygons and the complete attributing of each polygon.  

6.  In December of 2003, an error was corrected in the boundary on the valley 
floor between the Tulare Lake Region and the San Joaquin Region.  It resulted
in a new shape file, DWRDAUV20.SHP.  The only major change that resulted was, 
on the westside, DAU 220 became larger and two polygons, and DAU 248 became 
smaller.  On the eastside, DAU 234 became smaller, and DAU 214 became larger. 
In addition, a new column was added containing the California Planning Update  
Area number.      

Projection Information:

The data is in a transverse mercator projection called CA105.  It is identical 
to the UTM projections, except the central meridian is -120 degrees (120 
degrees west).  For comparison, UTM 10 has a central meridian of 123 degrees 
west, and UTM 11 has a central meridian of 117 degrees west.

Information about the Data Files:

AUTOCAD (DWG) File:

The file DWRDAUV10.DWG is a Autocad 12 file, and contains the following layers:

Layer		Description				
0		AutoCAD's default layer		
D_B		DAU linework
D_A		DAU attribute (consisting of a "D" and a 3 character 
		string code) 
D_T		The DAU code (3 character string) as text

Shapefile:

Following is an explanation of the attributes in the DWRDAUV10.DBF file:

X_COORD		The X coordinate of the interior point in the delineated area
Y_COORD		The Y coordinate of the interior point in the delineated area
ACRES		The acreage of the delineated area	
DAU_CODE	The DAU code (3 character string) of the delineated area
DAU_NAME	The DAU name (character string) of the delineated area
PSA_CODE	The PSA code (3 character string) of PSA encompassing the 
		delineated area
PSA_NAME	The PSA name (character string) of the PSA encompassing the 
		delineated area
HR_CODE		The HR code (2 character string) of the HR encompassing the 
		delineated area
HR_NAME		The HR name (character string) of the HR encompassing the 
		delineated area
DAUID_CODE	The DAU identification code (8 character string), which is a 
		concatenation of the HR_CODE, PSA_CODE, and DAU_CODE.   
PA_NO           The California Planning Update area number (6 character number).
